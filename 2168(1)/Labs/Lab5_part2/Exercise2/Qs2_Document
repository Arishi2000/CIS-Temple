in this question I used stack as a data structure to solve this problem
so basically in this method we are pushing opening characters into stack and
then pop up when closing symbols show up, we will pop up
and check with its appropriate symbol if it is the appropriate one then we will  do the same further
till stack is not empty, if not then return the index at that point at where error happens.
