Problem 1 -> Big-O runtime of getInversionCount() is O(n^2)

Problem 2 :
(b)  O(n^2)
(c) Merge sort was faster on some files which had low value of n while merge sort was faster on large n
(d) yeah both are stable sorting algorithms
(e) For small value of n (number of elements), Insertion sort would be better than merge sort since merge sort have high constant value on runtime complexity
    while on large values of n, merge sort will always be faster than insertion sort.
